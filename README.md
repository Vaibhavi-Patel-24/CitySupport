**Problem statement**

* Current methods of locating and accessing municipal facilities are inefficient and lack 
transparency. Users often struggle to find accurate and up-to-date information about 
services, operating hours, and charges. Additionally, there is no centralized platform 
for business owners to update their service information. This project aims to solve 
these problems by creating a web application that provides comprehensive 
information and improves user interaction with municipal services. *

**Proposed Solution**

* The scope of the City Support encompasses the development, implementation, and 
continuous improvement of a web application aimed at enhancing access to municipal 
services. The system will cater to local residents, tourists, business owners, and 
various other stakeholders, providing them with comprehensive information about 
municipal facilities, navigation assistance, and a platform for interaction and 
feedback. *
