## 📌 Problem Statement
Current methods of locating and accessing municipal facilities are inefficient and lack transparency.  
- Users often struggle to find accurate and up-to-date information about services, operating hours, and charges.  
- There is no centralized platform for business owners to update their service information.  

This project aims to solve these problems by creating a **web application** that provides comprehensive information and improves user interaction with municipal services.
